# COBOL Code Bench

<img src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64b934072f796fffbb0ce278/OcyCB82hpMun9m3G0hpVK.png">


This project is designed to generate COBOL code for provided CobolCodeBench using various language models. It leverages state-of-the-art AI models to assist in code generation tasks, making it easier for developers to create COBOL programs efficiently.

## Features

- **Model Integration**: Supports multiple modes for loading models for code generation like API and Hugging Face.
- **Evaluation**: Provides tools to evaluate the generated code against expected outputs.
- **Data Handling**: Includes utilities for loading and processing instruction and completion sets from JSON files.
- **Command Execution**: Utilities for executing shell commands related to COBOL code compilation.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the code generator, execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

Make sure to configure the model settings in `config/model_config.py` as needed.

## Generation only
```
python main.py --model gpt-4o --mode Instruct --method chat-api --generation-only
```

## Run evaluation after generation is complete
```
python evaluate.py
```

## Or run specific evaluation types
```
python evaluate.py --bert-score
python evaluate.py --compile-execute
```

## Or specify a different model/mode than the last run
```
python evaluate.py --model claude-sonnet --mode Complete
```
## Setting .env for API keys
```

⚠️ **Warning: Repository Migration and Refactoring in Progress** ⚠️

Please be aware that this repository has recently been migrated and is undergoing significant refactoring from a private enterprise environment to a public repository.

**As a result, you may experience unstable performance, unexpected behavior, and incomplete features.**

We are actively working to stabilize the codebase and improve its functionality in this new public setting.


**Current Progress & To-Do:**

Here's a high-level overview of the ongoing work. You can check back here for updates on our progress:

* [x] ~~Core codebase migration complete~~
* [ ] Testing Initial model integration framework (huggingface, chat-api)
* [ ] Logs setup to capture compilation and execution logs seperately & Scores seperately
* [ ] Generator features stabilized
* [ ] Evaluator features stabilized
* [ ] Security review of API and input validation
* [ ] Comprehensive testing implemented
* [ ] Essential documentation updated
* [ ] Full documentation complete

**We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to make this repository stable and reliable.**

If you encounter any issues, please feel free to report them as GitHub issues. However, please keep in mind that our immediate focus is on stabilizing the core functionality.
